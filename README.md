# Task Management

#### What is a task management app?

A task management app is an application that is useful for organizing and scheduling tasks that need to be done. Unlike writing tasks manually, its advantage is unlimited access anywhere as long as there is an internet connection. Therefore, in the third month of the Bearmentor bootcamp, I, Muhammad Farhan, will create a web-based Task Management application as an added value for my portfolio

## About This Project

This application was created to test my ability in building applications using React.js and TailwindCSS technologies, guided by professional mentors at Bearmentor Bootcamp. In the future, this application will continue to be developed as the learning process progresses.
